            <p class="green">
              Swift signed to Big Machine Records in 2005, debuting as a country
              singer with the albums Taylor Swift (2006) and Fearless (2008).
              The singles "Teardrops on My Guitar", "Love Story", and "You
              Belong with Me" found crossover success on country and pop radio
              formats. She incorporated rock on Speak Now (2010) and electronic
              on Red (2012), later re-calibrating her image from country to pop
              with the synth-pop set 1989 (2014); the ensuing media scrutiny
              inspired the hip-hop-imbued Reputation (2017). The albums
              contained the Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles "We Are Never
              Ever Getting Back Together", "Shake It Off", "Blank Space", "Bad
              Blood" and "Look What You Made Me Do".
