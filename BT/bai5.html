        <h1>5. Groups of selectors</h1>
        <p>A comma-separated list of selectors represents the union of all elements selected by each of the individual selectors in the list. (A comma is U+002C.) For example, in CSS when several selectors share the same declarations, they may be grouped into a comma-separated list. White space may appear before and/or after the comma.</p>
        <div class="code-block">
            <strong>CSS example:</strong>
            <br><br>
            In this example, we condense three rules with identical declarations into one. Thus,
            <br><br>
            h1 { font-family: sans-serif }<br>
            h2 { font-family: sans-serif }<br>
            h3 { font-family: sans-serif }<br>
            <br>
            is equivalent to:
            <br><br>
            h1, h2, h3 { font-family: sans-serif }
        </div>
